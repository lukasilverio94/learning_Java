# CHALLENGE

## Description
In an online course portal, each user has a unique code, represented by an integer.

Each instructor on the portal can have multiple courses, and a student can enroll in as many courses as they wish. Therefore, the total number of students for an instructor is not simply the sum of the students in all their courses, as some students may be enrolled in more than one course.

Instructor Alex has three courses: A, B, and C, and he wants to determine his total number of students.

Your program should read the students from courses A, B, and C of instructor Alex, then display the total number of unique students, as shown in the example.

### Example:
```
How many students for course A? 3
21
35
22

How many students for course B? 2
21
50

How many students for course C? 3
42
35
13
Total students: 6
```
